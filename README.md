# Yet Another Advent of Code Library

I'm using Advent of Code as way to learn rust, and made this
library of things useful for doing AoC puzzles.

This library will evolve over time as I figure stuff out and
come up with better patterns.

Nothing is documented (yet) but I might add some docs eventually.
